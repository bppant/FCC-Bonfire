#FCC-Bonfire
These are all of my Free Code Camp Bonfire solutions that I've completed while taking the course. Feel free to use them, if you want, but only if you are brutally stuck. Since they are written along the course they may not be "smart". If time permits I will make them "smart" but if you have one then I'd love to see it. 
Feel free to contact me: http://twitter.com/bppant/

P.S. It may be possible in future that FCC evolve their Bonfire challenges and my solution might not work! It this happens please do ping me so that I can update it asap.
